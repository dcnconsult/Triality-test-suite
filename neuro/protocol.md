# Preregistered EEG Entrainment Protocol (Draft)

**Design:** Randomized, double-blind, within-subject crossover (active vs sham).

**Enclosures:** Two identical Faraday-and-acoustic isolated chambers. Continuous logging of RF spectrum, vibration, temperature, humidity.

**Drive:** Tri-tone near model-predicted eigenfrequencies. Document scalp field strength in V/m and magnetic component in nT. Target \le 0.5 V/m at scalp (well below safety limits).

**Primary endpoints (pre-registered):**
- PLV change (theta–alpha and gamma), windowed averages.
- Cross-frequency coupling (phase–amplitude coupling).
- Spectral entropy change.
- Behavioral oddball RT variance (secondary).

**Inclusion/exclusion:** Healthy adults, no neuroactive meds on session days.

**Kill-switch K1:** No effects beyond sham across n≥30 and ≥2 replication attempts ⇒ retire SR/entrainment pillar.

**Analysis plan:** See `analysis/stats_plan.md`.
