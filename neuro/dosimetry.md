# Dosimetry Worksheet (Draft)

Document coil/electrode geometry, currents/voltages, distances, and compute estimated scalp field strengths.

- Electric field (quasi-static): estimate V/m using simple conductor models or FEM.
- Magnetic field: log in nT using calibrated magnetometer.
- Specific Absorption Rate (SAR): estimate using standard head models (when available).

All exposures must remain under applicable IEEE/ICNIRP guidelines.
