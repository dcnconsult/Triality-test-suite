# Theory Sketch (Minimal Math)

- **Coarse-graining:** define local solution density over integer triples satisfying x^3+y^3+z^3=k.
- **Fields:** Phi_j are moments of that density; physics lives in Phi.
- **Lagrangian:** quadratic kinetic + potential; cubic tri-coupling; optional quartics for stability.
- **Projection ansatz:** a rank-3 projector P maps 4D Lorentzian fields to tri-fields; preferred-frame limits must respect existing bounds.
- **Dimensional map D:** fixed from a small training set; predictions must generalize beyond it.
